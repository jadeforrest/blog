      <h3>27. Beth Adele Long on reliability and leadership</h3>
      <time datetime="2025-07-30T17:28:47.000Z">July 30, 2025</time>
      <p>I sit down with Beth Long to discuss her extensive experience with reliability engineering from working at companies like New Relic, Jeli, Gruntwork, and Adaptive Capacity Labs. Beth shares her insights on the role of executives in incident management, the balance between product development and reliability, and how different organizations approach incident coordination. We also explore reliability as a product and the importance of organizational culture in effective incident response. I learned a great deal, and thought about some aspects of reliability in completely new ways. I hope you do too!</p>

      <h3>25. Molly Graham on Google to Glue</h3>
      <time datetime="2025-05-21T14:00:00.000Z">May 21, 2025</time>
      <p>I had the opportunity to interview Molly Graham, who has an impressive background working at Google, Facebook, and Quip, among other places. In 2022, she founded Glue Club, a community for startup leaders to learn from each other. Molly is best known for her concept of &#39;giving away your Legos,&#39; which she developed from her experience with rapid organizational scaling. We discuss the emotional and practical aspects of change in startups. Molly also shares her (provative, deliberate, rare!) approach to organizational design, executive team dynamics, and her experience giving a TED Talk on the topic of cliff jumping versus ladder climbing with your career. It&#39;s a fascinating conversation full of insights for anyone interested in leadership and growth in fast-paced environments.</p>
