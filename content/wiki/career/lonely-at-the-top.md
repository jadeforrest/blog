It can be lonely as an executive. Advice from others:

* "One thing I personally have to fight is that I'm pretty focused when I'm working and have to remind myself to slow down and bullshit some."
* "Think about specific people I can ask for help. I need to ask for help more anyway and reaching out to people is a great way to be vulnerable and build the relationship."
* "Letting myself play a little bit in our fun Slack channels like Random. Iâ€™m a a playful person and working at a fully remote company this is the equivalent of hallway conversations about random things."
* "Looking outside the company for people I can talk shop - as the head of a function, being able to talk to other people with similar jobs is so very helpful to get perspective and see how many of my problems are universal, not just a result of my failings. I have no guilt about taking a 2 hour lunch in order to meet up with someone and get some real human time."
* Use online communities, or create your own community somewhere.
* Lunches with former coworkers is one of my favorite things.
* "Look for your sounding board buddy, ideally at a similar level if only one, or per topic area like people leadership, process, cross-functional and exec team dynamics, and product/technical direction exploration. Ask others if they have recommendations for a good buddy for you. They might volunteer!"

You're not alone being alone!
