## Dealing with equity

If you have options that will expire and don't have the cash to use them up, you can use a service like Esofund to front the money. They take a share of any profits. There are a number of services like this. But they do due diligence and often will decide not to fund it. Interestingly, whether or not they will front you for it is an interesting signal in its own right.
