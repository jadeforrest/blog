## Vendors

* [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com). The original and a very nice product. Expensive. Has some very nice new features around lifecycle management, guarded deploys with auto-rollback. Seems to be getting into observability, which I have mixed feelings about. I suspect their implementation might be most solid.

* [DevCycle](https://devcycle.com). Heard a good recommendation for this. Less expensive and a little less feature-full than LaunchDarkly. Has some impressive clients. Seems worth trying out.

* [Posthog](https://posthog.com/docs/feature-flags) has feature flags. They're part of a larger analytics suite, so makes sense if you want analytics. Inexpensive.

* DIY. It's not terrible difficult, but you'll keep on adding features until you've rebuilt one of these other products.
