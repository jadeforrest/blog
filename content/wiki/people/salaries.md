## Salaries

* Levels.fyi is a site that aggregates a lot of salary information. However, to do real comparisons can sometimes be hard. https://www.levels.fyi/t -- seems high to me, but you can filter by location.

* Indeed.com has a page that shows regional salaries. But it's only averages: https://www.indeed.com/career/product-manager/salaries

* I usually work with the HR team, and they subscribe to some sort of salary tool service (like [https://www.pave.com](https://www.pave.com/) ). We plug in the titles and locations and so on.
