title: 1:1 Meetings
---

## Not status

> *Sometimes people walk in and give me status reports, but that’s not what I want. It’s really about stepping back from all the urgency and having a strategic and interesting conversation. I’m like, “Hey, what’s going on? What’s the hardest thing on your plate right now?” You do this for a year, and people start to depend on that time to share what’s going on, on a more personal level.*\

1:1’s are the employee’s meeting. They shouldn’t be a status report, and you should set the expectation that they drive the meeting themselves. That said, have prepared material in your back pocket to keep the meeting running smoothly.

## 1:1 Structure and Rules

### Who do you have 1:1’s with?

* Direct reports
* Peers
* My boss

### Cadence

* Do not cancel 1:1 meetings; however, if you must, reschedule them at the same time
* 30 minutes
* Start weekly, back off to every other week if you both struggle to fill the time

### Discussion Points

* What are 1 or 2 things in our team that could be done more efficiently?
* What is one thing that I, or the company, could do to support you in achieving your goals?
* Share any up-leveled info, so details from leadership meetings, your bosses, etc.
* Review all hands info

### Be present

* bring a notebook (in person)
* put the notes online (in lattice)
* practice active listening
* put your phone away / close slack

### Format

* Start Positive - ask about them and their lives, and small talk for a minute.
* What’s front of mind? or What's on your mind?
* Ask Questions, don’t just listen
* Ask questions about career plans
* Give employees the time and space to think about what they want to express
* Ask direct but open-ended questions
* Express Gratitude
* Wrap up and name action items

## Lara Hogan's context questions

It’s important to get some context on the person you’re working with. In an ideal world, you’ll get along with and enjoy this person; that said, it’s not always possible or may take more time to build a relationship. To give you some understanding of the person, here are a few high-level things are worth understanding about them ([see Lara Hogan](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/) )

### Grumpiness

* What makes you grumpy?
* How will I know when you’re grumpy?
* How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

### Feedback & Recognition

* How do you like feedback - the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)
* How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens
* How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

### Goals & Support

* What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
* What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?
* What do you need from your manager? (You might ask, can you tell me about the best managers you've had in the past, and how they were helpful to you?)
* From your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)
* From your peers? (outside the team)

I often ask follow-up questions to the answers to these questions to help me clarify and understand.

### The Most Important Question

* What’s your favorite way to treat yourself?

## Task Relevant Maturity

[Task Relevant Maturity](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/management-concept/) is the idea that everyone is more skilled in some areas than others. In areas of high skill, delegate and verify. In areas of low-skill, provide coaching, support, and review. This allows you to trust and delegate where appropriate and grow team members where they need support.

You can adjust the frequency of your one-on-ones based on their current responsibilities.  The more comfortable you are with their TRM, the less often you'll need to check-in.

Meanwhile, when you promote them or give them a new challenge they lack experience in, this is the time you should meet more often (every 1-2 weeks), no matter how busy your schedule is. This is when they need you most and will be set up to fail and be frustrated otherwise.

## Skip-levels

Jade has written about [skip levels](https://www.rubick.com/skip-level-1-on-1s/).

Skip-level 1:1’s are how you can orient yourself to the department and what problems your team is dealing with. Skip-level meetings don’t take the place of your middle managers doing _their_ 1:1’s, and they don’t work at the same scale as a department-wide survey but can be an effective tool to keep me grounded on actual problems that need solutions.  Among the many benefits, skip-level 1-1s help build a stronger relationship with your organization, understand how your managers are performing, and gain first-hand accounts of how your decisions affect the people in your organization. ([source](https://jwongworks.com/blog/2019/4/16/the-skip-level-1-1) )

### The Rules

* Let your managers know you are doing it; no one wants to be surprised by your boss.
* Let your entire team know. Receiving an unexpected meeting invite from a senior leader can produce anxiety. Make sure the meeting invite shares your intent, agenda, and expectations. **Don’t scare people with blank meeting invites.**
* Establish rules of confidentiality. Reiterate the purpose of the meeting. Be a great active listener
* If you are aware of a recent achievement of this person, congratulate them.
* If you find yourself getting negative feedback in this skip-level meeting or disagreement about your decisions, do not get defensive about it. Stay curious and try to get as much understanding as you can from their perspective
* Do not preempt your manager. This is an opportunity to coach the IC in navigating the problem

## Troubleshooting

[The Vent](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/)

* Don’t problem solve. Don’t redirect. Don’t comfort.
* They want to be heard
* It’s done
* Break a rant
