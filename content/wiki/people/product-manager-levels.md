* [An introduction to the PM career path](https://www.productleaders.blog/blog/product-manager-career-paths)

* I like the [distinction between IC and managerial tracks for PMs](https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-pm-career-ladder-your-unofficial). Very nice.

* Lenny Rachitsky is probably the most followed product leader in the world. He has a [post on career ladders](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/product-management-career-ladders), but it is paid only. Has apparently 20 large companies and the traits each select for.

## Compensation

* Posthog has a [very nice calculator for their roles](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation)
