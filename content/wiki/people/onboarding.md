## Programs

* Will Larsen on [onboarding programs](https://lethain.com/engineering-onboarding-programs/).

## Software

* Jade used [Donut Onboarding](https://www.donut.com/solutions/onboarding/) in the past to set up repeatable onboarding processes. Very nice ability to set up roles, and put people in one or more roles that each have their own onboarding flow. Honestly, not everyone liked it. The main vehicle for the onboarding was through Slack, and meetings it set up for you. But I liked it quite a bit. Feels like checking your onboarding flow into github, as you can iterate on it after you initially establish it. But haven't used it in quite a few years.
