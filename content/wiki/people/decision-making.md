## Models

Good post on being explicit with decision-making models:

I'll add that there are other variations she hasn't listed. For example, "consent-based" decision-models. That's where the identified decision-maker can act, but any of the people around them can "veto" the idea if they have a "substantive objection". I.e., act by default, but others can pull the safety cord if it's disastrous.
