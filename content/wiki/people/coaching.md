* [Developing high performers](https://mollyg.substack.com/p/developing-high-performers) is a wonderful post from Molly G about how to accelerate the growth of capable people.

* [Layers of context](https://lethain.com/layers-of-context/) is a post by Will Larsen about how perspective can make for more impact and career progression

* [Advice for engineers, from a manager](https://marcorogers.com/blog/advice-for-engineers-from-a-manager) by Marco Rogers . Jade thought this was one of the best articles of its kind to share with ICs, so they can understand some of the ways they can have greater impact.

* [So you want to be promoted](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/so-you-want-to-be-promoted-pt-1/) (part 1 and especially part 2) by Rands. Goes over some aspects of promotions that most engineers overlook.
