* [Layers of context](https://lethain.com/layers-of-context/) is a post by Will Larsen about how perspective can make for more impact and career progression

* [Advice for engineers, from a manager](https://marcorogers.com/blog/advice-for-engineers-from-a-manager) by Marco Rogers . Jade thought this was one of the best articles of its kind to share with ICs, so they can understand some of the ways they can have greater impact.
