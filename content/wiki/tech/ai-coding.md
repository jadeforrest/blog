## Monitoring the situation

* A good way to stay abreast of AI tooling: [Rands Leadership Slack #ai-coding-tools](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)

## Background info

* [Claude Code tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@anthropic-ai/streams)
* [Claude Code best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)

## Workflow

* Document driven (need link)
* [An iterative approach that makes your genie less insane over time](https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/) Stdlib from Ghuntley (Cursor)
* [A structured approach to coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD4ktSkNCw4&t=1701s) by Ryan Carson. For Cursor but generally relevant.

## Adoption

* [The Gap Through Which We Praise the Machine](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html) on usability issues in agent coding, and why some people seem to be doing well and others aren't.
* [Nobody codes here anymore](https://open.substack.com/pub/ghiculescu/p/nobody-codes-here-anymore?r=8j0ru) A case study on adoption

## Drinking coolaid

* [Revenge of the Junior Developer](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer) - Steve Yegge (who has a vested interest in this) lays out his vision of where this is going: agents, agent fleets, etc.
