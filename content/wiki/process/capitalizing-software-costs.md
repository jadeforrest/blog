title: Capitalizing software costs

* Usually really worthwhile, but super painful.
* Rules are not usually very clear, and if you're not careful, can lead to a lot of onerous reporting requirements.

## Section 174 of US tax code

* For several years (from 2022 or so?), made the accounting for software development costs be treated not as a cost. So a software startup that made $1MM in revenue, and paid $1MM in software development costs, would have to amortize the salaries. This resulted in a much higher tax burden, and was arguably a large part of the reason we've seen tech layoffs so prominently the last few years.
* Here's a thread on [Hacker News about the topic](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44226145).
* It's possible this will be repealed in 2025.
