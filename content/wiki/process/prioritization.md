## Black Swan Farming

* [One of Jade's favorite posts on prioritization](https://blackswanfarming.com/experience-report-maersk-line/) behind a signup wall. About using economic modeling for prioritization.

## DRICE approach for prioritization

* [DRICE](https://open.substack.com/pub/lenny/p/introducing-drice-a-modern-prioritization) - Start out with Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort. But then add in return on investment, or basically dev time divided by dollars.

## Kano prioritization

* [The Complete Guide to Kano prioritization](https://foldingburritos.com/blog/kano-model/). Satisfaction, disatisfaction, must haves. A very good guide.
