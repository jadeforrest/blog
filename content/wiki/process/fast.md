## Basic overview

* Bring everyone together to work as one Collective. A Collective is a group that can be as small as a few people, or as large as 150 people.
* Visually represent business goals on a wall (or virtual equivalent). This also visualizes constraints.
* Let the Collective self-organize and self-select into smaller teams to break down and do the work.
* On a short cadence, sync and repeat. Typically, this means twice a week.
