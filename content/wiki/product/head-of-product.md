title: Advice for (new) head of product
---

## First 90 days advice

This is advice compiled from other product leaders.

* Meet with business stakeholders.
* There is a lot more business stakeholder management than engineering roles.
* Work with PMs on cadence for syncs, reviews of how Product and Tech support the business.
* Measure product success against KPIs proposed at project inception.
* Spend time with customers (users, buyers, or both)
* Clarify product direction.
* Communicate with org and make sure they're aligned.

* **Figure out the main and secondary controllers/influencers of product and strategy for your product(s) and the company**. Start building relationships with them and understand their perspective and motivation. Usually the places to start are founders, CEO, exec team, early employees, customer-facing leaders (not necessarily managers), and maybe the board.
* **Assess the PM, Design, Engineering, DevRel, Product Marketing, and Docs teams + artifact quality**. Start making the most important changes in investment, approach, etc. that you see (assertively, quickly, with high leverage changes) in partnership with the leadership of any involved functions.
* **Meet with as many customers as possible**, partnering with customer-facing roles.
  * Speak directly with as many customers as you can
  * Take at least one trip into the field with sales
  * Hear out what marketing/product marketing think about your place in the market and product, meeting with at least one analyst if that is relevant to the product
  * Spend a few days in customer success/support and hear out that group's leadership (not just management) on the issues they see customers facing and that they face in satisfying customers
* **Somewhere before the end of the 90 days share your assessment of the situation and what you're doing to drive positive change**. This probably takes several forms for different audiences (execs, product team, design+engineering, rest of company) and can be a great way to build alignment and gather more info if done collaboratively.

## Things an eng leader might overlook:

* Product direction setting and communication with the org.
* Product marketing is important.
* Rolling out new features post stability.
* Validation of product impact.
* You may need to do analyst or investor facing communication.
