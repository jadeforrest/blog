[Ash Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ash-patel-srepath/) interviewed me for the [SRE Path](https://www.srepath.com) podcast. He said the conversation got "spicier and spicier. At one point, I was hunting for my favorite sparkling passionfruit drink to cool thinks down."

This was the spicy part:

"One of the challenges youâ€™ll sometimes find in organizations is that platform engineering teams can be the source of a lot of work for the rest of the organization. Every time you deprecate an API or create a standard approach that requires migration, you are creating work for all your consumers. The purpose of a platform team is to drive efficiencies in the rest of engineering, not cause additional work!"

 We also talked about:

* Focusing platform organizations on their customers.
* How I've gone about diagnosing team issues.
