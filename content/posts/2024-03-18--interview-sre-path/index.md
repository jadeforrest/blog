[Ash Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ash-patel-srepath/) interviewed me for the [SRE Path](https://www.srepath.com) podcast. He said the conversation got "spicier and spicier. At one point, I was hunting for my favorite sparkling passionfruit drink to cool thinks down.".

 We talked about:

* Focusing platform organizations on their customers.
* How platform teams can create a lot of work for the rest of the organization, and how to avoid it. This was the ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ part of the interview.
* How I've gone about diagnosing team issues.
