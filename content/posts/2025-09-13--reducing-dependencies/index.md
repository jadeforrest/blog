When your company gets large enough, you'll start having problems with dependencies. Here's how to address it.

## What do I mean by dependencies?

* Teams not able to deliver their work without other teams doing work for them.
* Projects that can't be successful unless a lot of teams do work.

## Signs you have a problem

* Big projects are always challenging and problematic.
* Lots of efforts to solve this through project management and better tracking.
* Lots of efforts to solve this through heroism.
* Lots of efforts to solve this through process.

The problem is that you have a structural problem, so none of these will work consistently. I write more about how people [try to work around these structural problems](/independent-executor-model/).

## All the things you can do

* **Reorganize the teams** to reduce dependencies. Generally favor cross-functional organization. [Team Topology](/management-books/) style structures. Or [FaST](/fast-agile/) approaches if you have a higher tolerance for experimental but promising approaches.
* **Make your projects smaller and more incremental**. It's easier to ship smaller things.
* **Focus on fewer things**. If you halve the number of projects, that means each projects gets that much more attention, project management, attention to detail, etc. If a manager is project managing four things, they're dramatically less effective that project managing one thing. Consider constraints on the number of projects per team.
* **Define engagement models for your teams**. I write about a lot of these in [Coordination models](/coordination-models/). Be very explicit about the way teams work with each other. You might have a team page in the wiki, with a section on the engagement model for each team. Examples of engagement models: [self-service](/platform-teams-and-the-self-service-model/), [independent executor](/independent-executor-model/), [objective expert](/objective-expert-model/). Moving all your platform teams to self-service is an example of a very good improvement.
* **Define how to work across team boundaries**. Away teams, open source model, etc. I haven't completed some of those posts yet, but have some detail in the [independent executor](/independent-executor-model/) post.
* **Look at your bottlenecks**. You always will have [bottleneck teams](/bottleneck-team/). Not only are these usually the most problematic places in engineering, they also are often where a fix can have outsized impact throughout the whole organization.
* **Have someone who explicitly looks at dependencies and org structure**. If you don't have enough systems thinkers in the organization, it might be useful to make this more explicitly something that the right person is thinking about a lot. Dependencies are one of the main decelerants for your org -- make someone responsible for taking care of the org structure.
* **Bring in consultants or advisors**. This can go very well, or very poorly. But it can be a good idea to bring in outside expertise. Be wary of [SAFe](/wiki/process/safe/) or other one size fits all approaches. I can help, or refer you to others.
