Hiring well is one of the most high-leverage activities companies can make. Modest investments of time can make the difference between you hiring the best people for your company, and taking forever to hire people who may not be a great match.

The most common (and **terrible**) way to organize interviews is to:
* Decide on a group of people who can interview the candidate. 
* Come up with a list of areas you want them to dig in on. 
* Have someone schedule the time slots
* Have each person give a recommendation to hire or reject the candidate. 

This is problematic in a million ways:

* When I’ve been on panels like this, I’ve had candidates tell me every person asked them the same questions. So the candidate experience is pretty terrible. 
* You’re not really guaranteeing you are going to learn what you need to with the candidate. 
* You have no idea of what each interviewer is doing, so you have no way of knowing if their feedback is solid or not. I've had times I've been in interviews like this and when the interviewer was giving feedback, I asked which questions they asked, only to find the questions were poorly conceived. 

The main problem is that there is no **coordination**. 

So let me share an interview format I use. 

The basic process is
1. Make a list of assertions that should be true for the person to be right for this role. For example: works cooperatively across departments, experienced with org design and scaling organizations, able to attract and hire great talent. Or decomposes technical problems effectively, communicates technical matters clearly. Loosely prioritize this list of assertions. You won't use them all.
2. For each assertion, list an interview question (or method) that will uncover evidence of how strong the candidate is in this area. 
3. Group your assertions by category, like Managing Projects, Managing People, Managing process, and Technical decision-making. These are your **interview sections**. 
4. Copy this [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WlkzpOMoQnmaG5wVTjV2JFtbis1ykKjlaE0unO8XbEA/edit#) and put your assertions and questions into the format, adding the people who will be responsible for each section. And what a good answer might look like. For example, I might say something like, *An poor answer would be switching to Kanban, or introducing standups (yes these can improve things, but the impact is very local). A better answer would be something like XYZ. A perfect answer would relate the impact to the results on the company, and the results would have made a substantial difference for the company.* 
5. (optional) Choose _two_ people to do each interview (they'll observe the interview better, and learn from each other, which increases your organizations ability to select candidates over time). One is okay if you can't find a second person.
6. Work with each interviewer to improve the questions they will ask. You act as editor, read through the interview and think about the interview experience, and whether questions duplicate each other. Make sure you have confidence answering those questions will answer the questions you're looking for.
7. Copy and paste the questions you're asking to [search for bias in the questions you're asking](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/). I often find I'm gender coding in a way that might exclude women -- for example, in a recent interview I used two masculine-coded words: "active" and "force". Usually removing the gender coding also makes it more clear. 

After every interview, encourage everyone to ask themself these questions:

1. Did I get the information I needed to make a confidence assessment of the candidate. If not, I should change my "assertions". 
2. Did I understand the results of the assertion by asking the questions I did? If not, I should tweak the questions I ask. 
3. Did I hear a particularly good or poor answer to the questions? If so, I may want to tweak the "what does a good response look like" section.

So why is this format effective?

1. It separates out what you want to learn, from how you are going to achieve it. This makes it easier to iterate on the interview format after every interview. 
2. It is explicit about what you’re looking for in a good answer. This reduces bias, because you will have thought of it beforehand. This helps with interviewees that may not be the best interviewee, but are giving answers that indicate they might actually be the right person for the job. 

I hope you find this useful. Let me know what you think!
