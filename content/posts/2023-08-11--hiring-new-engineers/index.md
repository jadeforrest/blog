Hiring junior engineers is challenging. I've seen so many junior engineers get hired but then be supported poorly.

There is a lot to write about this topic, but today I'd like to highlight a wonderful writeup by [John Hyland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhyland/) on what is the best example of new engineer hiring I've encountered.

John set up and ran the "Ignite" program for several years, and shares how it ran. It's kind of perfect! The junior engineers are hired, work in groups of junior engineers on real problems for the company. They then join teams for several weeks and contribute to those teams. After a few rotations, they're placed on a permanent team. 

There are a lot of interesting hacks they used to make this program work, so I highly recommend it if you're interested in the topic!

What I like best about this program is it just seems so effective. The company gets much more effective junior engineers, who are less of a challenge for their teams when they start. They're well indoctrinated into the engineering processes before they even join the team. And they contribute even while they're getting trained. The engineers, in turn, have a much more positive experience, get to see a cross-section of the company and understand how the product works. And they have a cohort of fellow junior engineers they can rely on in the future. It's just really fine management work.

The post is a three part series. You can start here: [Running New Relicâ€™s Ignite Program, Part 1 - Hiring](https://djspinmonkey.github.io/2023/07/10/ignite-hiring/).

## Applicability

This program is most appropriate for medium sized companies or larger. But it mostly depends on how quickly you're hiring. At New Relic, we did it when we were well over 60 teams, but it could be done at an earlier stage. 

[John](https://hachyderm.io/@djspinmonkey/110872453575362629): "if you hire at least 20-30 engineers annually, it's likely that 10-15 of them could be early career, which is easily enough to justify putting some resources into doing a good job with it... That's a higher ratio of early career engineers than many companies go with, and depending on the specific kind of engineering the company does, that may be reasonable. So, you'll want to adjust those ratios to whatever you're comfortable with, and consider what resulting hiring rate is needed to warrant an early career hiring program based on your particular circumstances."

That said, a lot of the lessons from this can be applied to earlier stage companies. I think the design of this program is a really good thing to emulate.

## Thank you

[John Hyland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhyland/) is a former colleague of mine, and the author of the post I feature here. Contact them if you're interested in further details after reading this post. I suspect they'd jump at a chance to do similar programs at other companies, and even to help others who are doing so.
