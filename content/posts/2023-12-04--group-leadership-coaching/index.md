I often have people approach me about coaching or advisory work. But their company won't pay for it, so they want to pay as individuals. Some of my clients do this despite it being expensive, because they get so much value out of it (and I do offer a discount for individuals). 

But others find this too expensive, even with the discount[^1]. So, I often find I can't work with them.

     If you do the math of what it takes to run a business coaching people, it's hard to make a salary close to the amount you can make as a full-time employee.

I've started running **group coaching** sessions. These are small groups of leaders, who meet regularly. Each person has some time for their own topics. They are well moderated, and you're able to learn from the topics other people bring to the conversation. I've run similar groups in the past, and found that a benefit is that people learn about topics they may not be paying attention to.

If you are interested in group coaching, you can fill out this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftpz2h0HyK5KpMHFQq7aaI1N-rd5MlI5CuyViweSVEw7YPRQ/viewform)? I'll see if there is a group with availability, and send you a proposal that includes the times and the costs. If it looks good to you, maybe I'll see you in a group leadership session soon!

## Thank you
