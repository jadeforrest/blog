I often have people approach me about coaching or advisory work. But their company won't pay for it, so they want to pay as individuals. Some of my clients do this despite it being expensive, because they get so much value out of it (and I do offer a discount for individuals). 

But others find this too expensive, even with the discount[^1]. So, I often find I can't work with them.

     If you do the math of what it takes to run a business coaching people, it's hard to make a salary close to the amount you can make as a full-time employee.

Iâ€™m exploring the idea of doing **group leadership coaching**. This would be small groups of leaders, who would meet regularly, and each person would have some time for their topics. It would be well moderated, and you'd be able to learn learn from the topics other people bring to the conversation. I've run similar groups in the past, and found that a benefit is that people learn about topics they may not be paying attention to.

If you think you might be interested in group coaching, can you fill out this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftpz2h0HyK5KpMHFQq7aaI1N-rd5MlI5CuyViweSVEw7YPRQ/viewform)? I'll play with the results and put together a proposal. If it looks good to you, maybe I'll see you in a group leadership session soon!

## Thank you
