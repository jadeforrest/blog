I often have people approach me about coaching or advisory work. But they find individual coaching to be too expensive.

So, I run **group leadership coaching** sessions. These are small groups of leaders who meet regularly. Each person has some time for their own topics. They are well facilitated, and everybody learns from each other. You can often get better coaching from a well run group than from an individual. 

I run several groups. Participants are technical or organizational leaders, and people aspiring to these roles.

If you are interested in group leadership coaching, fill out this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftpz2h0HyK5KpMHFQq7aaI1N-rd5MlI5CuyViweSVEw7YPRQ/viewform). I'll send you a proposal that includes the proposed time, cost, and detailed information on how it works. You can then decide if you want to proceed. Perhaps I'll see you in a group leadership session soon!

## Thank you
