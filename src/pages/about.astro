        pattern-match you to a few things. See below for a longer list.
      </p>

      <h2>Hello</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Jade Rubick. I build thriving engineering organizations. My
        specialty is humane, results-focused organizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also like to share what I've learned. So I write blog posts and have a
        newsletter course for beginning managers. Most of my blog posts are a
        part of Engineering Leadership Weekly: <a href="/newsletter/"
          >sign up</a
        >, and you'll receive one a week, for a little over a year.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="/contact">Contact me</a> if you'd like to discuss how I might be
        able to help your organization. You can see my background, companies I've
        worked with, and what people say about working with me on <a
          href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaderubick/">LinkedIn</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>How I help</h2>

      <p>I help companies in a couple of ways:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Executive advisor or coach.</li>
        <li>Fractional doer.</li>
        <li>Interim VP of Engineering.</li>
        <li>Group leadership coach</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As <strong>executive advisor</strong>, I meet weekly or biweekly with one
        or more leaders in your organization. We conduct working sessions where we
        problem-solve your current challenges. You bring context, I bring expertise,
        and together we come up with better solutions than either of us could individually.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a <strong>fractional doer</strong>, you point me at a problem in your
        organization, and I take care of it. You get the benefit of hiring someone
        with deep expertise who can produce amazing results in a short period of
        time. Fractional work also encompasses evaluation of an organization -- I
        can take a look at what is working and what isn't, and give you a list of
        recommendations. A benefit of fractional work is that you can hire a level
        of talent that would otherwise be unaffordable or inaccessible.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an <strong>Interim VP of Engineering</strong>, I take leadership for a
        limited period of time (usually 3-9 months). I improve the organization
        and hire my replacement.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a <strong>group leadership coach</strong>, I run group sessions for
        frontline managers, directors, and heads of engineering. Learn more <a
          href="/group-leadership-coaching/">here</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>Is your company a fit?</h2>

      <p>
        I work with companies that deliver software, across most industries. I
        avoid crypto engagements.
      </p>

      <p>
        My approach is to focus on both effectiveness and sustainability.
        Companies that treat employees like resources or cogs aren't going to be
        a good fit.
      </p>

      <p>
        I focus on companies with 10-100 engineers. I have experience outside of
        both ends of that, however, so feel free to contact me if you want to
        explore a fit.
      </p>

      <h2>Fractional projects</h2>

      <p>Some typical fractional projects:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I need to hire a lot of people quickly and need someone to improve our
          hiring practices.
        </li>

        <li>
          We need to uplevel our engineering management team. How can I improve
          things as quickly as possible?
        </li>

        <li>
          Engineering delivery and quality has been degrading over time. What do
          we do?
        </li>

        <li>
          We're getting to the size we need to break up into multiple teams.
        </li>

        <li>I need to implement engineering levels and salary bands.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Areas of expertise</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Execution issues</strong>. Engineering departments exist to
        create value for the company and for customers. But the most common
        failure mode of an engineering organization is for delivery to stall. I
        can help diagnose and address what is getting in the way of the team
        being effective.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Leveling up another engineering leader</strong>. If you have an
        engineering leader who is effective but inexperienced, I can help. Many
        challenges they face will be "anti-intuitive". The solutions evade smart
        people, and unless you have the right mental models, you can fail. I've
        worked with many promising but less experienced leaders, and helped them
        have the impact the company requires of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Hiring (strategy, process)</strong>. Why should anyone want to
        work for your company? I can help you <a
          href="/creating-a-hiring-strategy/">work out your strategy</a
        > for getting the best talent you can in the door. Some companies distinguish
        themselves by their work culture. Other companies attract candidates by the
        problem space they are in. Others may offer their employees freedoms, such
        as working on open source, or short work weeks. To hire in this competitive
        environment, you need a good hiring strategy. And you need a good retention
        strategy. Your hiring process also needs to be competitive. The <a
          href="/how-to-speed-up-hiring/"
          >time you take to move candidates through your hiring pipeline</a
        > can decide whether that candidate becomes an employee. I can help you improve
        your candidate experience and hiring funnel. You can see examples of some
        of the things I recommend <a href="/startup-hiring-and-recruiting/"
          >here</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Quality and tech debt</strong>. Many teams get mired in technical
        debt or are unable to release quality software. I can help with
        improvements that will help them be proud of their work. And help them
        make progress on intractable technical debt.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Reliability practices</strong>. If your engineers struggle with
        poor reliability, I can help. Generally, this means setting up process for
        incidents, communication, and follow-up work.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Distributed work</strong>. I have nine years of experience in
        distributed organizations. And I have decades of experience in colocated
        organizations. I can help you navigate how to manage remote work.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Organizational structure</strong>. I can help you design your
        engineering organization for growth. Engineering teams bias towards
        patterns that don't scale. I understand the math and the art of designing
        organization structure. You can see my writing on <a
          href="/coordination-models/">coordination models</a
        >, <a href="/how-to-build-silos-and-decrease-collaboration/">silos</a>,
        and <a href="/tag/org-design">organizational design</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Early stage scaling</strong>. Companies that are beginning to
        grow are often tempted to hire an engineering leader early. I can help
        you navigate your organizations' needs so you can hire the skills you
        need at the right time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Diversity, equity, and inclusion</strong>. I will be the first to
        recommend not bringing in a white male to help with DE&I. I can be useful
        here, though. My experience is both with hiring and retention. At New
        Relic, we achieved an employee NPS score that was equal across
        demographic groups. At Gremlin, I increased underrepresented
        representation in engineering from 7% to 38% in a little over a year.
        What helps is engineering levels, fair compensation, a good promotion
        process, and a humane hiring process. Underrepresented minorities are the
        best test of company culture. Improvements you make for them usually make
        the company better for everyone: improving retention and hiring.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Incremental delivery</strong>. Incremental delivery is a powerful
        source of competitive advantage. It results in higher feedback, so your
        projects more often hit the mark. Perceived velocity increases, because
        customers see more improvements. Yet, companies often struggle to make
        progress on this.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Project visibility</strong>. Sometimes it can seem like
        engineering isn't doing anything. This is often the result of poor
        project reporting and communication. What is useful here is something
        lightweight that improves accountability and oversight.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Servicification</strong>. I was a leader in New Relic's
        servicification effort. Moving to services can stall an engineering
        organization for years. I can make these efforts much less problematic. I
        even have some experimental approaches that may avoid most of the pain of
        servicification altogether.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Employee retention</strong>. Engineers are in demand, and it can
        be hard to build a work culture that keeps them engaged and happy. I can
        help advise on what it takes to build a work environment that allows
        people to do their best work, and makes them want to stay at your
        company. And I can help arrest retention challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Engineering levels and compensation</strong>. I've developed
        engineering levels three times now. And I've developed compensation for
        engineering several times in the past. Usually there is a historical
        challenge and a going-forward challenge. I have a great interest in
        solutions that are effective and fair.
