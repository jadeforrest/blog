    <h2>About the course</h2>

    <FAQSection variant="compact">
      <dt>What is the format for this course?</dt>
      <dd>It is an email-based newsletter course.</dd>

      <dt>How much time does this course require?</dt>
      <dd>
        The amount of time you devote to it depends on you.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Frontline Management Bootcamp course has some assignments. But all
        assignments are optional, and it's up to you to decide which you want to
        integrate into your management practice. For example, there is an
        assignment to set up your support network, with some suggestions for how
        to do so. You don't have to do any of them, but you'll probably find it
        helpful.
      </dd>

      <dt>Are there assessments or quizzes with this course?</dt>
      <dd>No. The course does not have any assessments.</dd>

      <dt>Is there any interaction with other students?</dt>
      <dd>
        Not currently. I did have a Slack community for participants, but we
        haven't had a critical mass yet.
      </dd>

      <dt>I can't afford your course, but really want to take it</dt>
      <dd>
        <a href="/contact/">Contact me!</a> I'll set you up.
      </dd>

      <dt>How much email will I be receiving, and for how long?</dt>
      <dd>
        The Frontline Management Bootcamp course is delivered weekly. It is a
        five month course.
        <br />
        <br />
        After the course, you will get all the content from the Engineering
        Leadership Weekly newsletter. That is another year plus of newsletters.
      </dd>

      <dt>Can I sign up for both the newsletter and course?</dt>
      <dd>
        You can, but if you're thinking about that, I would just sign up for the
        course. At the end of the course, you will automatically transition into
        receiving the newsletter. You will get a few duplicate emails, but not
        many.
      </dd>

      <dt>If I pay for the course and don't like it, can I get a refund?</dt>
      <dd>
        Yes, I provide refunds with no questions asked, for two months after the
        course starts. <a href="/contact/">Contact me</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Is it annoying to unsubscribe if I'm finished with it?</dt>
      <dd>Every email has an unsubscribe link in it. It should be super easy.</dd>

      <dt>How do I give you feedback on any of the course content?</dt>
      <dd>
        You can reply to any email and I'll read it. I really appreciate
        feedback!
      </dd>

      <dt>How relevant is this content for non-engineering managers and leaders?</dt>
      <dd>
        The Frontline Management course is very engineering focused. It's best
        suited for engineering managers, though some content may be applicable to
        other technical disciplines.
