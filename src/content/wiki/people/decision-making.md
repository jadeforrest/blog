## Models

* [Good post on being explicit with decision-making models](https://mollyg.substack.com/p/decision-making). I'll add that there are other variations Molly Graham didn't list. For example, "consent-based" decision-models. That's where the identified decision-maker can act, but any of the people around them can "veto" the idea if they have a "substantive objection". I.e., act by default, but others can pull the safety cord if it's disastrous.
* [Disagree and let's see](https://mollyg.substack.com/p/disagree-and-lets-see) is one of my favorite posts of 2025, about a more authentic alternative to Disagree and Commit. By Molly Graham.
* [Alternatives to disagree and commit](https://www.nadyadukeboone.com/alternatives-to-disagree-and-commit/) by Nadya Duke Boone, is a great followup to Molly's post.
