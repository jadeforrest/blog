# Migration Decisions

1. **Directory Structure:** astro-blog/ subdirectory - DONE
2. **Git Strategy:** Track in parent repo - DONE
3. **Pagination Strategy:** Traditional pagination initially - DEFERRED infinite scroll
4. **Custom Markdown:** Use MDX initially - DEFERRED native Astro conversion
5. **Search:** Switch to Pagefind - DEFERRED FlexSearch removal
6. **Syntax Highlighting:** Try Shiki with github-dark theme - DECIDED (may revisit if issues)
