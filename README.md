# Rubick.com Blog

This repository contains the source code for [rubick.com](https://www.rubick.com), a personal blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

The blog features blog posts, a wiki section, full-text search, RSS feeds, and responsive design. Content is written in MDX (Markdown with React components) for flexibility and portability.

## Features

- **Modern Astro framework** with static site generation for fast performance and zero hosting costs
- **MDX content** - Write posts in Markdown with embedded React components
- **Full-text search** powered by Pagefind
- **Wiki section** for structured knowledge base content
- **Tag-based organization** for easy content discovery
- **RSS feed** for subscribers
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Syntax highlighting** with Shiki
- **Automatic sitemap generation**
- **SEO optimized** with OpenGraph tags

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm

### Installation

```sh
npm install
```

### Development

Start the local development server at `localhost:4321`:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This automatically copies post images from `src/content/posts/` to `public/` before starting the dev server.

### Building

Build the production site to `./dist/`:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will:
1. Copy post images to the public directory
2. Build the Astro site
3. Generate the search index with Pagefind

### Preview

Preview your production build locally:

```sh
npm run preview
```

## History and Credits

This blog was originally built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and migrated to [Astro](https://astro.build) for improved performance and developer experience. The legacy Gatsby implementation is preserved in the `gatsby-blog/` directory.

### Gatsby Blog Origins

The original Gatsby blog was created by Baobab, building upon [Greg Lobinski's](https://github.com/greglobinski) excellent [hero-blog-starter](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-hero-blog/). Key improvements in that version included:

- Fixed draft post leaking into production
- Improved RSS feed with dates and proper filtering
- Redesigned contact form using Google Scripts
- Support for multiple tags per post
- Custom React components in Markdown
- Infinite scroll with graceful pagination fallback
- Refined design with tracedSVG image placeholders
