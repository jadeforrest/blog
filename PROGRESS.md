**Current Phase:** 4 - All Posts Migrated ✅
**Working State:** All 101 posts migrated and building successfully!

## What's Working

- ✅ All 101 posts migrated from Gatsby
- ✅ MDX support with custom ReImg component
- ✅ Images display correctly with Astro asset handling (31 images optimized)

- ✅ Posts route to root level (not /posts/)
- ✅ Production build succeeds with all posts
- ✅ Full styling with theme variables
- ✅ BaseLayout with header and footer
- ✅ Article styling matches Gatsby design
- ✅ Tags, author, date display nicely
- ✅ Open Sans font loaded
- ✅ Responsive layout
- ✅ Homepage with post list (all 101 posts)
- ✅ Posts sorted by date (newest first)
- ✅ Navigation between homepage and posts
- ❌ No images in post list (Gatsby version had cover images)
- ❌ No "View all tags" / "View all posts" links
- ❌ Haven't tested posts with custom MDX components beyond ReImg

## Next Steps
