## Adjusting to Director+ roles

* Jade has written up his learnings on the topic in [advice for new directors](https://www.rubick.com/advice-for-new-directors/)
* Ileanell Perez wrote about [her experience in an interim Director of Engineering](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/nothing-prepares-you-first-director-role) role.
* Rands wrote about the way he's crystalized executive leadership [become the consequence](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/become-the-consequence/)

## Learning more about the business

* Someone recommended this newsletter to [learn SaaS business context](https://substack.com/@cloudedjudgement)
* [Financial modeling for startups, an introduction](https://www.fivecastfinancial.com/guides/financial-modeling-for-startups-an-introduction/)
* [Rule of 40](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/rule-of-40/)
* Talk with finance people and review costs, models, etc.
* Talk with sales engineers.
* Talk with people in the growth function. Understand the numbers they track and care about.
* Someone I trust: I had a session on this at a CPO accelerator from Giff Constable and he's now teaching a [maven class](https://maven.com/giff-constable/financial-fluency) on this. I found Giff to be a great teacher. 
* You can get an MBA, or do an equivalent amount of self-study, although that's high effort.
